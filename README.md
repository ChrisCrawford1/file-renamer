# File Renamer
This is a simple script I created to help me rename my photos from a camera to put them in a numbered format. Currently it only renames image files with sepecific extensions but this can be changed very easily by adding desired extensions into the list of `file_types`
# Requirements
- **Python 3.6+**
There is an included Pipfile if you are using virtual environments to run the code.

# How To Use
Simply change directory to where you have stored the script and run 
```python
python filerenamer.py 
 ```
You will be prompted for the full path of the directory that contains the files. Once you enter the directory the code will execute and provide a message upon success.
